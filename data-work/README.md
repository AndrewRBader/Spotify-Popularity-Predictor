1) USA_test-data-prep-work.ipynb: set up the initial US Spotify Data set for ML models
2) top-10_data-trimming-resampling-work.ipynb
    - top 10 data was very imbalanced so needed random resampling
    - also applied statistical trimming techniques on the features
3) top-10_ data-visualization-work.ipynb
    - visualized the results of these techniques on the features vs top 10 split
4) top-50-US_resampled-data-processing.ipynb
    - tried resampling techniques on the top 50 US data set to see if the data changed at all
5) top-50-US_resampled-data-processing.ipynb
    - not much of a change seen with resampling, probably expected since there isn't much of a count difference between top 10 vs not top 10
6) top-50-US_testing-plots.ipynb
    - testing out various plotting visualization methodologies
